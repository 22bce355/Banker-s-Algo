# Banker's Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It includes both parts of the algorithm:
1. **Finding a Safe Sequence**: Ensuring that the system is in a safe state.
2. **Handling Resource Requests**: Processing resource requests to maintain system safety.

## Features

- **Safe Sequence Detection**: Determines if the system is in a safe state by finding a safe sequence of resource allocation.
- **Resource Request Handling**: Checks if a new resource request can be safely granted without causing a deadlock.
## Example

### Safe Sequence Detection

1. **Input**: Provide the total processes, total resources, allocated resources, and maximum resources in the system.
2. **Output**: A safe sequence of processes, if one exists.
### Resource Request Handling
1. **Input**: Provide the resource request from a process.
2. **Output**: Whether the request can be safely granted or not.
